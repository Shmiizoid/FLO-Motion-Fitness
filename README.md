# User Stories

As a new user, I am looking for an app that I can use to track my progress and try new workouts.

As a potential employer, I want to see that Emilio can demonstrate successful Restful routes and CRUD using a MEN stack.

As a novice lifter, I want an app that I can use to update my workouts as I progress in my fitness journey.

# Unsolved problems and hurdles

One hurdle I had during this project was that I changed my idea for the application after submitting the initial proposal. I decided it would be best not to make an application so similar to my previous "Express Store" application which featured Pokemon cards. I instead focused on an original passion of mine, fitness, and had to start over. 

I tried to utilize bootstrap but did not find it helpful for this particular project. I am sure with more experience, bootstrap would be a good tool but I did not implement it until I had designed a bit of the application myself using css.

An unsolved problem I have is that I wanted there to be a login for a more custom experience for each user. I will continue to work on this application to add more features.
